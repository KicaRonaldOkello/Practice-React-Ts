Fortunately, the in-flight entertainment included a new cybercrime drama called Mr. Robot.</p><p>This show takes technical realism to levels unprecedented for Hollywood. It succeeded in distracting me from the awkwardness of being “that guy” with the crying baby. And I even learned a few things about information security.</p><p>Out of respect for readers who haven’t yet watched this Golden Globe-winning series, I’ve purged this article of any reference to characters or plots in the story.&nbsp;<strong>Read on with confidence — this is a spoiler-free article.</strong></p><p>Without further ado, here are five information security lessons from season 1 of Mr. Robot.</p><p><br></p><p>Hackers don’t need to steal your phone — that would be too obvious, and would only give them access to your data from the past.</p><p>Instead, they can gain control of your phone using spyware. They can do this in minutes, and you’ll never even know.</p><p>In Mr. Robot, one of the characters installs a root kit on someone’s phone in less time than it takes to shower. Using Flexispy — a widely-used Android spyware tool — the character “roots” the phone — putting it in superuser mode — and then hides the normal superuser icon to obscure the fact that the phone has been tampered with.</p><p><br></p><p>From now on, the character is able to monitor all of that phone’s digital and audio communications.</p><p>Word to the wise — using your phone’s thumbprint scanner or setting a lock screen password will make it much harder for a hacker to do this to you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
